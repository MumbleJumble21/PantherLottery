# PantherLottery

  Welcome to the Royal Casino , You have been hired as a software developer
to create the automated Panther lottery System. The casino wants you to take the
users name and have them type in their cash amount. The system will then have the
user play the game. The way the game works is that the user will enter five
Integers from 1 to 99. The system will then generate a list of five winning numbers
from 1 to 99 . If the winning number is on the users list then it will say they won
and the payout would be 3^n dollars, where n is the position of the winning
number within the winning line up. So if their guesses were 4 5 6 7 10  and the
winning numbers were  7 81 14 20 15 then the payout is 3^4. Remember a person
can win on multiple numbers.

  The system should continue to run until the user either runs out of money or
the user opts to stop playing. Each betting cycle cost $25. The owner of the casino
has given you some test cases to give you an idea of how he wants the system to
work. The manager Grandmaster Bernhard has also asked for you to ensure that
you leave proper comments in your code because they want to make sure that they
can review your work after so you can be properly compensated.
